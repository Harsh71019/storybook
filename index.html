        Lord Krishna — an avatar of Vishnu — noticed that three beings closest to him had fallen into the trap of <em>ahankar</em> (ego). Rather than punish them, he devised a beautiful plan — to send Hanuman, the greatest devotee, as the mirror that would reflect their pride back at them.

            <p>
              Krishna sent Garuda — the king of birds and lord of the skies — to the Gandhamadan mountain with a message: invite Hanuman to Dwarka. Garuda flew at his absolute peak, the wind bending around his mighty wings.
            </p>
            <p>
              He found Hanuman calmly sitting under a tree, chanting <em>"Rama… Rama… Rama…"</em> Garuda delivered the invitation. Hanuman simply nodded and said, <strong>"You go ahead. I will follow."</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Garuda smirked inwardly — <em>an old monkey walking to Dwarka?</em> — and flew back with all his speed. But when he landed at the palace gates, his heart stopped. Hanuman was already there, seated serenely before Krishna, as if he had been waiting for hours.

          <div class="chapter__body">
            <p>
              Before Hanuman's arrival, Krishna had commanded Sudarshan Chakra to guard the palace gate — to stop anyone from entering without permission. The Chakra spun with blazing ferocity, confident that no force in existence could pass through it.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Hanuman arrived and found the spinning discus blocking his path, he did not stop. He did not flinch. He simply reached out and <strong>caught the Sudarshan Chakra in his palm.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              In some accounts, Hanuman placed the Chakra inside his cheek — the way one holds a betel nut — and walked right in. He then calmly walked up to Krishna and placed the Chakra at his feet. The most feared weapon in creation had been rendered a harmless trinket by Hanuman's devotion.

          <h2 class="chapter__title">The Question to Satyabhama</h2>
          <div class="chapter__body">
            <p>
              Inside the palace, Krishna had arranged one final test. He asked Satyabhama to dress as Goddess Sita, knowing that Hanuman — the eternal devotee of Ram — would surely be struck by her beauty. Satyabhama adorned herself in her finest silk and jewellery, certain that even a monkey sage would be dazzled.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Hanuman entered, he immediately bowed to Krishna, seeing him as his Rama. Then he glanced toward Satyabhama. He paused. He tilted his head, genuinely puzzled, and asked with complete innocence:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="chapter__quote">
              "My Lord… where is Mother Sita? And who is this <em>maidservant</em> sitting beside you?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The palace fell silent. Satyabhama's ornaments suddenly felt very heavy. She had dressed to be worshipped as a goddess — and had been seen as a servant. Not out of cruelty, but because Hanuman's heart held only one form of beauty: that of Mother Sita.
            </p>
            <div class="chapter__moral">
              <span class="chapter__moral-label">Ego shattered</span>
              The pride of beauty was extinguished by pure devotion.

            After all three had been humbled, Lord Krishna revealed his divine form — radiant, infinite, all-knowing. He spoke to them gently, without reproach:
          </p>
          <blockquote class="conclusion__quote">
            "Speed, power, and beauty — these are not yours. They are gifts I placed within you for my service. The moment you claimed them as your own and became proud of them, you forgot me. And in forgetting me, you lost the very source of your greatness."
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Garuda bowed his mighty head. Sudarshan Chakra rested still at Krishna's feet. Satyabhama wept with gratitude. And Hanuman sat quietly in the corner, lost in the name of Ram, unaware that he had just been the instrument of one of the greatest divine lessons ever given.
